## Materials from class


### Articles

- [What is an ontology?](https://medium.com/seek-blog/ontology-whats-that-17679130aa69)

### Videos 

- [OpenAI Hide & Seek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M): Video about research done by OpenAI on multi-agent systems that play hide and seek.
- [Chappie snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At_C4jfxEg0): Clip from a movie (Chappie, 2015) where a police droid is stolen and trained by criminals.
The movie actually gets a lot of things right about learning from experience and how data influences AI behaviour.

They also offer their own courses, including reading material and interactive Python-notebooks to explore Data Science & AI-related concepts.
- [KhanAcademy (math)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math): A lot of techniques in AI are based on math. If you would like to explore AI more,
there are plenty of useful courses on KhanAcademy to help you brush up on all the relevant math.
- [KhanAcademy (cryptography)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/crypt/v/intro-to-cryptography): Extra topic, provides more 
information about ancient cryptography and how Alan Turing was involved in eventually cracking the enigma code.

### Videos

- [The danger of AI is weirder than you think (Ted Talk by Janelle Shane)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhCzX0iLnOc): A TED talk 
by a wonderful lady who specializes in weird AI behaviour. She also has a [blog](https://www.aiweirdness.com/)!
- [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g39AagVW0s0): YouTuber who does silly hobby projects with AI. A great way to get motivated
for your own personal projects.
